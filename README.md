# 42-Logtime-Checker

## Important
#### Navigate to your intra profile, top-right corner click on your profile, settings API, create a new app and have the client id and client token ready for the script

### How to install:
#### Copy the following command and paste it in your terminal
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Dwimpy/42-Logtime-Checker/raw/main/install.sh -o install.sh && chmod +x ./install.sh && $(basename $SHELL) ./install.sh 
```
## Apparently the API only returns the log time with a 2 day delay, so the last 2 days are tracked
